00:01 Let's begin by looking at why you might choose MongoDB
00:05 over other NoSQL databases, other document databases,
00:09 or even other relational databases.
00:12 I'm sure you've heard of MongoDB.
00:14 That's why you're taking this course.
00:15 But how popular is it relative to other databases?
00:19 Is it really the right choice?
00:20 Well, let's look at some data from 2017.
00:23 If you compare MongoDB against other NoSQL databases,
00:27 Cassandra, CouchDB, RavenDB, things like that.
00:31 You will find one of these databases is unlike the others.
00:34 Look at that, that's incredible,
00:36 how much more popular MongoDB is over these.
00:39 It's not just the popularity that it's five,
00:42 10 times, maybe 50 times more popular than RavenDB.
00:46 That's great.
00:47 That's very important.
00:47 But also, the trend.
00:50 These others are either flat or turning downwards.
00:51 And this is, besides the little blip here,
00:54 based on probably the end of the year numbers
00:57 or something like that.
00:58 At the end of the data, this is a really big deal.
01:01 This is incredible how much growth is here,
01:04 and it's still going up.
01:05 MongoDB is really, really popular
01:07 in terms of a database that people are using.
01:11 And that's great because that means it's well-tested.
01:14 When we get the section a little bit later,
01:16 we'll look at some of the users of MongoDB.
01:18 But it's really important
01:19 that there are some heavy workloads put onto these databases
01:23 that you're going to depend upon.
01:24 And if it can take what those people are doing,
01:26 surely, it can take what you have to throw at it as well.
01:29 Now, MongoDB is also loved.
01:31 If you look at Stack Overflow,
01:33 at their 2017 Developer's Survey,
01:36 and you look at the most loved databases:
01:38 these are databases that the developers are using currently
01:43 and how they feel about it.
01:44 We see MongoDB ranks right near the top.
01:46 So, definitely 55% of the people
01:49 who are using MongoDB love it compared to
01:51 say SQLite or Cassandra.
01:54 So, this is pretty good.
01:55 But what's even more interesting
01:56 is that it's the most wanted database.
01:59 These are technologies that you're not currently
02:01 able to work with but you would like to.
02:03 So, there are tons of people that want to work with MongoDB
02:05 but for whatever reason, they've got some Legacy system
02:07 built on MySQL or whatever, they don't get the chance to.
02:11 All these pieces of data tell you
02:13 MongoDB is a really good technology to have
02:15 in your tool belt.
02:16 And it's easy to get ahold of.
02:18 MongoDB is open source and it's free.
02:20 You can just go to github.com/mongodb/mongo
02:23 and clone it and it's right there.
02:25 You can see it has 11,000 stars, 3,000 forks.
02:29 And this screenshot I took here was updated two hours ago.
02:32 It's under very, very active development.
02:34 It's a live and vibrant project.
02:36 Finally, if you actually want to get MongoDB,
02:38 don't go to GitHub.
02:40 GitHub is cool, it's great.
02:41 You have the source but don't go there.
02:42 What you really want to do is you want
02:43 to go to mongodb.com/download-center.
02:47 Or just go to mongodb.com and click Download.
02:49 It'll take you here.
02:50 And you download here, you get it as binary.
02:53 So, if you're on Mac,
02:54 I recommend you use Homebrew to install it.
02:56 But you can also download a tarball.
02:58 If you're on Windows, get the MSI.
03:00 And on Linux, you can actually install it
03:02 with aptitude or some package manager like that.
03:05 In this course, we're not going to go into the details
03:07 of setting up MongoDB.
03:08 Just follow the instructions.
03:09 In the full MongoDB course you have,
03:11 we walk through all the steps,
03:12 but we just want to get started.
03:13 This the quick start.
03:14 So, let's keep moving.
