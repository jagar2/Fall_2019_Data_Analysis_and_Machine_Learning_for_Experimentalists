00:00 The ODM we're going to use for this course
00:01 is MongoEngine, and you can find it's homepage
00:04 and details about it, documentation and so on,
00:07 at MongoEngine.org.
00:08 So MongoEngine is open source like many things
00:11 you'll find in Python, as we said,
00:12 it depends upon PyMongo.
00:14 You saw us install it earlier,
00:16 we just did Pip install MongoEngine
00:18 and that installed PyMongo with it.
00:20 We did that through the requirements file
00:21 but you can do that directly if you prefer.
00:23 You can find MongoEngine on GitHub.
00:26 You can see that it's quite popular,
00:27 almost 2,000 stars.
00:29 This is much more popular that the other MongoDB ODMs,
00:33 as far as I can tell, looking at the other ones,
00:35 this is the definitely most popular,
00:37 at least, among the most popular of them,
00:39 and it's very actively under development.
00:41 I just took this screenshot right now
00:43 before I started recording here
00:45 to give you the latest version.
00:46 You can see that it's been updated in the last 24 hours,
00:50 and some other stuff under the actual code
00:53 has been updated in the last 21 hours,
00:56 so very active, this is important
00:57 for an open source project you're going to depend upon,
01:00 so I think you know, judging by that,
01:02 MongoEngine is the best choice,
01:03 and the API is excellent,
01:04 we're going to start working with it next.
