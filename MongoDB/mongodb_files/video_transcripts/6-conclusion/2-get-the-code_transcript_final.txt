00:00 I want to take this moment
00:01 to remind you to get the source code, come over to:
00:04 Github.com/MikeCKennedy/MongoDB-QuickStart-Course
00:08 and star and fork this so you're sure to have a copy.
00:12 So one thing I do want to take you through
00:14 really quick, two things.
00:15 One, I covered in the beginning,
00:17 is there is the starter code, which is here.
00:20 This is exactly what we started from.
00:22 And here is what we have finished with.
00:25 You can see, right there, 15 minutes ago
00:27 I wrote the final code.
00:29 But I also wanted to make sure
00:30 there were saved points along the way,
00:32 so if we go back here and check out the branches,
00:35 you'll see there's all these different branches.
00:37 So these are all different save points that you can grab.
00:40 So if I go here, for example,
00:42 you can see final registered and list cages,
00:45 guests can now book a snake into a cage, and things like,
00:48 so these are different points in the course
00:50 that you can go back and forward to.
00:51 So be sure to make use of the branches
00:54 and things like that if that can help you.
