00:00 We sound like querying the database
00:01 is pretty straightforward.
00:02 The way it works is we start
00:04 with the collection,
00:05 or the type that represents the collection,
00:07 we want to work with.
00:08 And then we say ".filter"
00:10 so here we're saying filter,
00:11 and we want to do a match, where the email
00:14 equals the value of the email variable.
00:16 And you could have more than one thing in here.
00:18 You could have more than one filter statement,
00:19 and those basically combine as an and.
00:23 Now this would return
00:25 potentially a bunch of owners,
00:26 but we don't want a bunch of owners.
00:29 We want the one that we know matches this email,
00:31 so we can say ".first"
00:32 and it'll give us the one, or at least the first,
00:34 item to match.
00:36 If there's no match, we get none back.
00:38 We don't get a crash or anything like that.
