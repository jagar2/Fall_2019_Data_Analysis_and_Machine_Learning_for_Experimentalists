00:01 So before we finish the host side,
00:03 where you actually can see your bookings
00:05 and things like that,
00:06 that turns out to be one of the most complex
00:08 types of queries we're doing in this entire application.
00:12 I want to make sure that you can book some stuff,
00:14 you can see it so the data comes out when we write it.
00:16 That'll make a lot more sense.
00:17 So let's take a moment and focus
00:18 on the guest side of the things.
00:21 Let people come in, log in, create an account,
00:24 register their snakes and so on.
00:26 So if we go up to the top
00:27 to our little switch action thing here,
00:30 notice that I'm using the create and login from host,
00:33 there's no reason to write that code twice,
00:35 we'll just use that one.
00:36 Now the thing I want to focus on for a moment is
00:38 adding a snake and viewing your snake.
00:40 Now this is super, super similar
00:42 to what we already did so let's go ahead
00:44 and just talk through this real quick
00:46 instead of write it from scratch.
00:47 So just like before, we have to have an account,
00:50 ask a few basic questions like what is your snake's name,
00:53 let them cancel by hitting nothing in the first one,
00:55 get the information about the snake
00:57 and then we call the function "add snake"
00:59 and you know, you could see this is very, very similar
01:02 so we're going to get the owner,
01:03 get the owner back and maybe it makes more sense
01:06 because we've been writing others like this,
01:07 to code like this.
01:09 We're going to create the snake and save it,
01:10 but remember the relationship between snake and owners
01:13 is managed by the snake IDs inside of the owners,
01:17 so we're going to go get a fresh copy of the owner
01:18 from the database,
01:20 update that, and save it.
01:22 Then we'll go back to the snake that we just created.
01:25 Also, we'll call a quick reload account
01:27 to make sure the snake ID,
01:28 for some reason if they get reused real quick,
01:29 are in the active in memory account.
01:32 So that's all it means to create a snake,
01:35 just like creating a cage was.
01:38 So everything's exactly the same there.
01:40 And then to view your snakes,
01:42 we just write the function,
01:43 get me the snakes for the user,
01:45 and we loop over them.
01:47 That again, is very much like the cages,
01:50 we get the owner, in this case just to be sure
01:53 that we have the fresh set of IDs there,
01:56 and then we do the ID in "owner.snake_ids"
01:59 and we can call to all function,
02:00 and then convert it to a list.
02:01 I suppose we could probably skip this,
02:03 but either way, this is all good.
02:05 So this gives us our snakes,
02:07 and we're going to list it out.
02:08 Let's go ahead and just run that to make sure
02:10 this is all working here.
02:11 This time, we're going to be a guest.
02:13 And let's go ahead and log in
02:14 and this time I want to log in as Sarah.
02:16 So Sarah's going to be my guest,
02:18 and Michael is going to be the person with the cages.
02:21 Login, so we're logging in as Sarah.
02:24 And let's say I'd like to view my snakes.
02:27 Hmm, you have zero snakes.
02:29 Okay, let's add a snake.
02:31 They'll have Slither,
02:33 and Slither is 1.2 meters long,
02:36 this is a large gardener,
02:39 and no those are not venomous,
02:40 so we've created Slither.
02:42 And let's add one more snake.
02:43 This is going to be Bully,
02:46 and Bully is .5, .4 meters let's say,
02:49 this is a bull snake.
02:52 Now if we say view your snakes,
02:55 there's your two snakes.
02:56 Okay, so our guest side of registering a snake
02:59 so that we can book it into a cage,
03:01 and viewing it, that kind of stuff, is all finished.
