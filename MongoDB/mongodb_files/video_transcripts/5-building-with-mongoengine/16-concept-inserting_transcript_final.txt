00:01 Now we built our app but let's review
00:02 some of the core concepts we saw along the way.
00:05 If we want to insert an object
00:07 we just create a standard Python object style.
00:11 We just say owner = owner.
00:13 Called the initializer.
00:15 We could either pass the values as keyword arguments
00:18 or we could say owner.name = name.
00:20 Owner.email = email.
00:22 And at this moment there is no ID associated
00:25 with this object.
00:26 But then we just call owner.save()
00:27 and now the object ID or whatever the primary key is
00:32 we can set functions to be called
00:33 when that happens for that generation.
00:36 Whatever that's going to be.
00:37 We've got it set after you call save,
00:40 so now you can start working with it
00:41 as if it came from the database.
00:43 We also might want to insert a bunch of things.
00:46 It turns out, if you have 100,000 items to insert,
00:49 and you create one save, create one called save,
00:52 create one called save, it's a lot of database
00:55 back and forth, and it's very slow.
00:56 So what you would rather do is create a list of them.
00:59 So here we have a bunch of snakes we want to save,
01:01 we create a bunch of them, put them in this list,
01:03 and then you call snake.objects().insert(snakes)
01:05 and you give it the list, and that's much quicker
01:07 if you want to do a bulk insert type of thing.
