00:00 The most straightforward way
00:01 to make changes to a document, or to a record
00:04 is to go get it from the database,
00:06 change the class, and call save.
00:08 So in this example,
00:09 we're going to go get the owner out of the database.
00:11 Make sure that's all good, don't want to have errors.
00:14 We're going to create a snake,
00:15 we're going to do work with the snake,
00:17 and then we want to append the snake ID
00:21 onto the owners snake ID collection.
00:25 So on line 11 we say owner.snakeIDs.append,
00:28 and we give it this new ID that was gotten
00:31 from the snake on line nine, when we called save.
00:33 And we save the owner, and that's that.
00:36 So we get the document, we make a change to it,
00:38 in the case of line 11 here, and then we just call save
00:40 and that pushes it back.
00:42 This works, but that transfers the entire document
00:45 out of the database, over to our app,
00:47 deserializes it, processes it,
00:49 and then reverses that back to the database.
00:52 That can be slow,
00:53 but that can also have concurrency issues.
00:56 If two people run this exact same method
00:59 at almost exactly the same time,
01:01 with the same email address, there's a chance
01:04 that one save is going to overwrite
01:06 the snake ID's of the other, right.
01:08 Both of them read the owner,
01:09 one makes a change, one makes a change,
01:11 one saves, the other saves.
01:12 You only have one snake, not two.
01:14 So there are challenges with this,
01:16 but if you're pretty confident that that's not an issue
01:18 you're going to run into, this is a really nice
01:20 and easy way to do it.
