00:00 Now, sometimes you don't want a quality in your matches.
00:03 You want some kind of operator like greater than
00:05 or less than or in or things like that.
00:09 So here you can see, we're going to the cage
00:11 and we're finding all the cages
00:13 where the square meters is at least the minimum size.
00:16 So just like with subdocuments, we use the double underscore
00:19 and the operator name, GTE, here
00:22 to actually do this query.
00:24 There's a bunch of dollar operators.
00:25 You can find them in the MongoDB documentation,
00:27 and you apply all of them in this way.
00:31 Now, the other thing that we're looking at here
00:32 that we didn't do in our app is count.
00:35 So if we want to know how many cages there were,
00:37 we could say do the query.count,
00:39 and it'll just do a count in the database
00:41 rather than pull all the objects back
00:44 where you do a length of it or something like that.
